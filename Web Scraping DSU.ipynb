The exposure they provided is way good for a person who wants to achieve excellence in the emerging field of Computer Science. Here potentials are harnessed, skills are developed, and confidence is built. It has been a great journey. Here in DSU we have great faculty members who are always willing to help under whom we have learnt a lot and as a result it really helped me to become a better version of myself. Becoming one of the leaders of CBS Society, gave me the confidence to lead. It provided me numerous opportunities to excel my technical and soft skills which are required for corporate sector. I am currently working as an iOS Developer at Time Based Software, LLC, it’s a U.S Based Company. I have more than 1 year of working experience in iOS Native Mobile Application Development.
